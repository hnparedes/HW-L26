## Features
- **Audio File Loading**: Load .wav files for analysis.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Process and clean the audio data to remove noise.  
- **RT60 Calculation**: Measure the reverberation time (RT60) using exponential decay analysis.  
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with an MVC design pattern, allowing clear separation of logic and interface.

## Requirements
